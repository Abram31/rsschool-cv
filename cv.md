About myself:

The first education is lawyer. From 2008 to 2014 I worked in my specialty in various organizations. Since 2014, I have been working as a deputy director in a construction company. I was involved in organizing the work of builders, working with customers and organizing the supply of materials to construction sites.

 ### And now I want to learn Front-End Development in RSSchool!

Code example:

```

Object.assign(Array.prototype, {   
        square() { 
          return this.map(num => {
            return Math.pow(num, 2);
        })},              
        cube() { 
          return this.map(num => Math.pow(num,3)
        )},                
        average() {
          let summ = this.reduce((curent, num,) => curent + num, 0
          ); return summ/this.length},               
        sum() {
          return this.reduce((curent, num) => curent + num
          )},              
        even() {
          return this.filter(function(num) {              
                if (num%2 === 0) {              
                return true;              
            }else {return false;}              
        }                 
         )},              
        odd() {
          return this.filter(function(num) {              
                if (num%2 === 0) {              
                return false;              
            }else {return true;}              
        }              
        )},              
})
